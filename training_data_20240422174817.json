This system can process 25,000 files per day with a retention period of 10 days. In the cloud, the workflow can handle 5,000 scans per day with a t3a.2xlarge instance, 10,000 scans per day with a c4.4xlarge instance, or 25,000 scans per day with a c4.8xlarge instance.",

In Stage 1, deep structure analysis is performed, which involves initial static file assessment and extraction of embedded active content. This stage can analyze over 50 different file types, extract artifacts and images, and perform automated decoding, decompilation, and shell code emulation. In Stage 2, threat detection and classification take place using machine learning and extensive experience. This stage can detect 290+ brands for ML-based phishing detection, extract and correlate a wide range of IOCs, detect malicious intent using 400+ generic behavior indicators, and employ ML-based similarity search to identify unknown threats and malicious clusters. In Stage 3, adaptive threat analysis is conducted on active content using adaptive threat analysis techniques. This stage involves detonating targeted attacks via specific application stacks or environments, bypassing anti-evasion checks, emulating JavaScript, VBS, PowerShell scripts, and automatically adapting the control flow to detect unknown threats. In Stage 4, threat intelligence and automation are performed, enabling automated threat hunting and real-time threat identification. The workflow can export data to MISP & STIX report formats, query the MetaDefender Cloud reputation service, integrate with open-source intelligence vendors, and generate YARA rules on a per-threat basis for scanning artifacts.",
